title: Should I use GEDCOM 5.5.1?
---

TODO: come up with real content here.

There are a lot of factors to consider. If you are creating GEDCOM support to read files, you should know that the vast majority of files created as of 2021 are in GEDCOM 5.5.1 format. Therefore, you will need to address this version of GEDCOM with a GEDCOM reading solution. Moving forward, it is anticipated that more and more software packages will support the creation of GEDCOM in version 7.0 format.
