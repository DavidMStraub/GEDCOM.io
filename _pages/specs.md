***Access to recent specifications and current repository***

*The section provides access to past and present specifications, and a public repository for future versions of FamilySearch GEDCOM. Specifications for versions 5.5 and 5.5.1 are provided since they are both currently in use in the marketplace.  The released version 7.0 is available in both PDF and HTML. Contributors are invited to work on future versions of FamilySearch GEDCOM through the public GitHub repository. A link to GEDCOM X, the backend data structure behind FamilySearch Family Tree, is available for learning and joining that repository.*
