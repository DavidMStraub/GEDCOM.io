- **Hypothesis** - sharing and collaborating on supposition of facts not yet provable with source records
- **Sources** - More source-centric capabilities including multi-person events and multi-purpose sources
- **Custom Tags** - work on gathering and referencing known custom tags and discuss how to organize, publish, and possibly add more formaility to the creation, use, and registration
- **Tools** - identify software tools, sample code and sample files that will be helpful to create and upgrade GEDCOM processing
- **Guides** - author and/or maintain FAQs, best practices, reference implementation guides, and other information that will be helpful to software developers
- **Compliance** - what cases, sample files, and minimum requirements will benefit developers in understanding what is working and what is not-working according to some level of compliance self-test 

*Note: Sample files is a sub-area of work that will benefit Tools, Guides, and Compliance.*
