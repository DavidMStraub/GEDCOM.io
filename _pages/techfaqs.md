# How do I list two places in an emigration?

Have paired immigration/emigration events:

```gedcom
1 EMIG
2 PLAC Nice, Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d'Azur, France
3 FROM City, Arrondissement, Department, Provence, Country
2 DATE 3 MAR 1903
1 IMMI
2 PLAC Manhattan, New York,  New York, USA
3 FROM Borough, City, State, Country
2 DATE 8 MAR 1903
```

# How do I record a stillborn child?

Use a `PHRASE` under the `AGE` at death

```gedcom
1 DEAT
2 AGE 0d
3 PHRASE Stillborn
```

# How do I record a miscarriage?

Not all researchers wish to include miscarriages in their families, but some do. For those who do, we recommend a non-pointer `CHIL` if no details are known:

```gedcom
1 CHIL @VOID@
2 PHRASE Miscarried after 6 months
```

or an `INDI` with `NO BIRT` if there is more to say about the child:

```gedcom
0 @EX1@ INDI
1 NAME Roman /Hernandez/
1 NO BIRT
2 PHRASE Miscarried after 6 months
```

# Why can an attribute have an age?

Once case is when the attribute has a clear start time; for example, educational degrees tend to be awarded at a measurable time

```gedcom
1 EDUC Ph.D. in Computer Science
2 AGE 26y
```

Another case is when an attribute was expected to be temporary and observed at a particular time; for example, physical descriptions tend to be temporary

```gedcom
1 DESC Mostly bald with bushy mustachios
2 AGE 38y
```

When birth date and date range of attribute are both known, `DATE` is generally better than `AGE`, but sometimes sources contain claims like "I weighed 6 stone when I was 12" without clear dates, hence the provision of `AGE` for attributes.

# How do I record illegitimate children?

This is one of many relationship situations with many possible technical complications, the best solutions to which are being discussed for possible revision in subsequent versions of GECDOM.

At present, the best available tool is `INDI.FAMC.PEDI`, one for each family:

```gedcom
0 @I1@ INDI
1 FAMC @F1@
2 PEDI BIRTH
3 PHRASE Illegitimate child
1 FAMC @F2@
2 PEDI BIRTH
3 PHRASE Born into this family, but not the father's own
```

Because the nature of `BIRTH` is unclear (is it about the biological progenitors of the child or the social family unit into which it is born?) and a topic some researchers have strong feelings about, either or both of the above may be recorded `PEDI OTHER` instead of `PEDI BIRTH` by some researchers.

# How do I mark a parent-child relationship as confidential?

There is no standard way to do this. However, this is an excellent use of the simplest form of extension: using a standard tag (`RESN` in this case) in a non-standard location (`FAMC` and `CHIL` in this case).

```gedcom
0 @I2@ INDI
1 FAMC @F3@
2 RESN CONFIDENTIAL
0 @F3@ FAM
1 CHIL @I2@
2 RESN CONFIDENTIAL
```

Note that with all confidential communications, it is important not only to mark the data as confidential but also to ensure that the recipient of the data understands in what cases they are to remove the confidential data and agrees to do so. `RESN` communicates the confidential nature, but does not enforce the desired behavior.

# There are so many languages; how do I pick LANG payloads?

If you know the GEDCOM 5.5.1 language name, [FHISO has a look-up table](https://github.com/fhiso/legacy-format/blob/master/languages.tsv). You can also look at the lists embedded in the reference 5.5.1-to-7.0 converter program.

If you know the language you want, [r12a has a very flexible search function](https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/).

You can also look through the [IANA registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) manually and assemble the appropriate tags as outlined in [BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47), though that's something of an expert-mode approach.

# What does `SEX X` mean?

It is what is officially known as [intersex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex), and is used in some countries on the birth records of children who do not obviously conform to the traditional biological definitions of male or female at birth.

The `SEX` structure is only for anatomical or biological sex at birth. For any related concept that might change and/or manifest later in life, an individual attribute should be used instead.

# How do I record polygamous families?

A `FAM` record should be used for each couple procreating or rearing offspring.
This may result in many `FAM` records for one social family unit.

A `FAM` record may also be used to represent the social family unit.
If it is desirable that all the spouses appear structurally equal, they may be linked using `ASSO` pointers with `ROLE SPOU` instead of `HUSB` and `WIFE` pointers.

It should be noted that some user interfaces may have more complete handling of `HUSB` and `WIFE` than they have for `ASSO`.

# How do I record a date without a year?

All dates in the `DateValue` datatype must have a year. Thus, you cannot use yearless dates as `DateValue`s.

However, you can add any date information as a `PHRASE`, as

If you could bound the year, you could add them as a PHRASE, as e.g.

```gedcom
2 DATE
3 PHRASE March 3rd (year unknown)
```

You might also consider bounding the year if possible, as e.g.

```gedcom
2 DATE BET 1820 AND 1840
3 PHRASE March 3rd (year unknown)
```


# How do I link to individual structures in my GEDCOM?

Inside a GEDCOM file, pointers do this using the cross-reference identifiers. However, cross-reference identifiers are *not* durable across import-export cycles and should not be used outside of a GEDCOM file.

If you wish to reference a part of a GEDCOM file from outside that file, you should use one of the durable identifier structures: `UID`, `REFN`, or `EXID`. There is currently no standard way to do this, so any implementation will need to decide how the links will be navigated. The following show a few examples, using all three kinds of identifiers in three different external files.

```gedcom
0 @I23@ INDI
1 NAME Arthur /Pendragon/
1 REFN King Arthur
2 TYPE English Royalty
1 EXID K1
2 TYPE https://example.com/MyIds
1 UID 4bd2c474-ec84-43cb-86ef-b51ab09c2ed2
```

```html
<span gedlink="somefile.ged?UID=4bd2c474-ec84-43cb-86ef-b51ab09c2ed2">King Author</span>
```

```xml
<Person>
  <InGed>
    <File>somefile.ged</File>
    <EXID type="https://example.com/MyIds">K1</EXID>
  </InGed>
  <Name>Arthur Pendragon</Name>
</Person>
```

```json
{
    "name": "Arthur",
    "gedcom":[
        {
            "file": "somefile.ged",
            "REFN": "King Arthur",
            "TYPE": "English Royalty"
        }
    ]
}
```
