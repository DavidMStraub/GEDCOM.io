The word GEDCOM is an acronym for **GE**nealogical **D**ata **Com**munication. GEDCOM is also the name of a computer program created by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the specifications of a file standard used for exchanging genealogical data between different desktop genealogical family tree software programs and websites. The original GEDCOM Standard program was released in 1984 and the last update to the standard was Version 5.5 in 1996. An incremental upgrade to 5.5.1 was released in 2019. GEDCOM is still relevant for personal private backup of family tree information, local ownership and control. A GEDCOM file is a UTF-8 text file containing genealogical information about individuals, and meta data linking these records together. The standard file extension used is a suffix, “ged” to indicate the file has been formatted using the GEDCOM data specification. Hundreds of website and desktop applications support the reading and writing of GEDCOM Files. Individuals continue to share their files for collaboration, reports, charts, special analysis, and other innovative purposes.
GEDCOM standard file format allows users to preserve, collaborate, import and export with different applications while maintaining control of the original copy.


## Why is GEDCOM Important ?

Genealogical (family tree) data is important, especially if it is your family! It contains significant information that links your family together in an electronic format. With GEDCOM, you control how you preserve, maintain, and share your data.

## How to Create and Use GEDCOM File ?

The GEDCOM standard is not a stand-alone program. It is used by genealogical desktop programs and websites to create a file that can be downloaded and then uploaded by other programs to assist in sharing information between different desktop programs and websites. You create a GEDCOM file by using the procedures specified by the desktop program or website you are using to store your genealogical data. Desktop programs and websites provide support for their own products and the way they implement the GEDCOM Standard may vary.

## Who owns the copyright to GEDCOM?
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints copyrighted the GEDCOM Standards 1987, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1999, 2019, 2021

## How can I use the published standards ?

## The GEDCOM 5.5.1 standard is copyright 2019, but I thought it was released in 1999?

A draft was released in 1999 and was widely circulated, but before it was made an official release FamilySearch began work on unrelated software projects. Without a new released standard, and recognizing the advantages of 5.5.1 over 5.5, many in the genealogical community implemented 5.5.1 despite its draft status. In 2019 FamilySearch officially released 5.5.1 without the draft notice.

## Can I use GEDCOM to share my family tree with someone else ?

Yes, this is the primary purpose of GEDCOM. Sharing a file should work assuming you both use a desktop program or a website that supports GEDCOM. However, most desktop programs and websites add various extensions to GEDCOM to support their own export features and it is possible that other desktop programs and websites might lack those features.  Further, those extensions added that are outside of the GEDCOM Standard are sometimes not imported correctly by other desktop programs and websites, even other desktop programs and websites that have similar features, so some special features might be lost in transmission.


## What's the difference between GEDCOM and GEDCOM-X ?

GEDCOM-X has a distinct family history data format. It was also created by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to address some perceived shortcomings in the original GEDCOM Version 5.5. GEDCOM-X is more closely related to the FamilySearch Family Tree’s internal data models and is widely implemented by software that interoperates with FamilySearch Family Tree. However, GEDCOM remains more common as a file format for sharing files between desktop programs and websites. See more at [GEDCOMX](http://www.gedcomx.org/About.html).

## What's New ?

Because information about your family is important, FamilySearch is committed to the continued improvement of the GEDCOM Standard. GEDCOM Version 7.0, announced at RootsTech Connect 2021, will allow your users to manage and share information more efficiently. GEDCOM Version 7.0 incorporates the added ability to include valuable photos and other files when they download a GEDCOM 7.0 file from your desktop program or website. All of this information will be packaged in a ZIP format. This feature is called GEDZip. Future updates to the GEDCOM Standard will continue to expand the capabilities of the GEDZip program. 

This renewed commitment to the GEDCOM Standard will increase the use and exchange of genealogical data through file transfers. Preservation options will increase along with many other valuable services. Barriers to entry will be lowered allowing for more innovators to participate. Software companies and developers will be able to address the needs of their users that may be restricted by the current GEDCOM specification so that changes can happen according to the collective voice of the marketplace. All of this will directly benefit those who rely on genealogical desktop programs and websites to organize and store their family tree information. 



## What is GEDZip?

GEDZip is an added feature of GEDCOM Version 7.0 for using a standard Zip archive file format to combine existing family tree data on a desktop program or website with external images and other files. The GEDZip file can be unzipped after transfer making the genealogical data and associate external files available together to a different desktop program or website. The exact procedures for downloading or uploading external files will vary according to the individual desktop program or website’s implementation of the GEDCOM Standard.
