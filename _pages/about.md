The word GEDCOM is an acronym for **GE**nealogical **D**ata **Com**munication. GEDCOM is also the name of a computer program created by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the specifications of a file standard used for exchanging genealogical data between different desktop genealogical family tree software programs and websites. The original GEDCOM Standard program was released in 1984 and the last update to the standard was Version 5.5 in 1996. An incremental upgrade to 5.5.1 was released in 2019. GEDCOM is still relevant for personal private backup of family tree information, local ownership and control. A GEDCOM file is a UTF-8 text file containing genealogical information about individuals, and meta data linking these records together. The standard file extension used is a suffix, “ged” to indicate the file has been formatted using the GEDCOM data specification. Hundreds of website and desktop applications support the reading and writing of GEDCOM Files. Individuals continue to share their files for collaboration, reports, charts, special analysis, and other innovative purposes.
GEDCOM standard file format allows users to preserve, collaborate, import and export with different applications while maintaining control of the original copy.
