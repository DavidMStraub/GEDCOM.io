GEDCOM is an acronym for **GE**nealogical **D**ata **COM**munication which was created by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints over 30 years ago. GEDCOM has become a de facto specification and file standard for exchanging genealogical data between different genealogy software and websites.
GEDCOM is still relevant for personal private backup of family tree information, local ownership and control. A GEDCOM file is a UTF-8 text file containing genealogical information about individual, and meta data linking these redorcds together. “ged” is the standard file extension used as a suffix to indicate the file has been formatted using the GEDCOM data specification. Hundreds of website and desktop applications support the reading and writing of GEDCOM Files. Individuals continue to share portions for collaboration, reports, charts, special analysis, and other innovative purposes.

GEDCOM standard file format allows to build, preserve, collaborate, import and export with different applications while maintaining control of the original copy.
Why is GEDCOM Important ?

Genealogical (family tree) data is important, especially if it is your family! It contains significant information that links your family together in an electronic format. With GEDCOM, you control how you create, preserve, maintain, and share your data.

## How to Create and Use GEDCOM File ?

To create a GEDCOM file , you can use free or paid services, some of which can be found in the FamilySearch Solutions Gallery or by searching “genealogy software” on the web. These services provide support for their products.
FamilySearch.org currently allows the upload of GEDCOM files to FamilySearch.org. Uploading your GEDCOM to FamilySearch gives you these benefits:

- FamilySearch preserves your file when you upload it . You have the ability to delete or replace it later on.
- Other users are able to see the information in your GEDCOM file but they cannot change it.
- Your uploaded information may help others further their research on the shared family tree

Other sites and applications also accept GEDCOM files and may integrate with FamilySearch Family Tree directly. Please contact them for how to upload and manage GEDCOM files with their services, many of which integrate with FamilySearch Family Tree to bridge the gap between your private data and the FamilySearch shared Family Tree.


## Who owns the copyright to GEDCOM?
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints copyrighted the GEDCOM Standards 1987, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1999, 2019, 2021

## How can I use the published standards ?

The standards may be copied for the purpose of reviewing or programming of genealogical software, provided the below notice is included. All other rights reserved.

Copyright © 1987, 1989, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1999, 2019, 2021 by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This document may be copied for purposes of review or programming of genealogical software, provided this notice is included. All other rights reserved.

## The GEDCOM 5.5.1 standard is copyright 2019, but I thought it was released in 1999?

A draft was released in 1999 and was widely circulated, but before it was made an official release FamilySearch began work on unrelated software projects. Without a new released standard, and recognizing the advantages of 5.5.1 over 5.5, many in the genealogical community implemented 5.5.1 despite its draft status. In 2019 FamilySearch officially released 5.5.1 without the draft notice.

## Can I use GEDCOM to share my family tree with someone else ?

This is the primary purpose of GEDCOM, and should work assuming you both use products that support GEDCOM. However, most software adds various extensions to GEDCOM to export features they have that other software might lack, and those extensions are sometimes not imported correctly by other software, even other software with similar features, so you might see some special features getting lost in transmission.


## What's the difference between GEDCOM and GEDCOM-X ?

GEDCOM-X is a distinct family history data format, also created by the church, which addresses some perceived shortcomings in GEDCOM. GEDCOM-X is related to FamilySearch Family Tree's internal data models and is widely implemented by software that interoperates with FamilySearch Family Tree. However, GEDCOM remains more common as a file format for sharing files between software platforms. See more at [GEDCOMX](http://www.gedcomx.org/About.html).

## What's New ?

GEDCOM Version 7 announced at RootsTech Connect 2021 will allow you store more information more efficiently, with the ability to include valuable photos and other files. All of this information can be packaged in the ZIP format. This feature is called GEDZip. Your family is important.FamilySearch is here to help you and your community preserve your family history, including images and stories in ways that work best for everyone.
This renewed commitment to GEDCOM will increase the use and exchange of genealogical data through file transfer. Privacy and preservation options will increase along with many other valuable services. Barriers to entry will be lowered allowing for more innovators to participate. Software companies and developers will be able to communicate the needs of their users that may be restricted by the current GEDCOM specification so that changes can happen according to the collective voice of the marketplace.


# What is GEDZip?

GEDZip is a feature of GEDCOM Version 7.0 for using a standard archive file format for combining GEDCOM data with associated images and other files. The GEDZip file can be unzipped after transfer making the genealogical data and associate external files workable together on the new environment.
